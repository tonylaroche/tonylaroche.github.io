### Design is important

When your average person thinks of design, they're imagining the way something looks. People who have some knowledge of the subject would say that design is the way something works.

Both statements are correct in their own way, but when it comes to designing consumer products. You're entering a new area that very often gets overlooked. **The People.**

You see, a product is only as good as the community it serves, regardless of the beauty of your product.

If you wanted to build 'Uber for Snacks' where you could set a price, push a button, and have someone _(wanting to make some easy cash on the side)_ deliver a bag of assorted snacks to your home, you'd think the most important thing would be having a sweet looking app and a flawless user experience, but if your community consists of drug dealers and hookers, it won't work.

Video games are a real-life example of this. If you've ever played MW2... or Fortnite, the actual gameplay and graphics are killer but if you're playing online multiplayer, you will be called a faggot and killed multiple times by some 12-year old.

### Be snobby at first

Basically, when you're building a new product you want to focus on building a very exclusive, invite-only, curated community. It'll allow you to maintain greater control, ensure high-quality content, and set a standard for future users.

This may seem very elitist at first, and it is. But if you want to design a great product you have to be willing to think like this.

### Soho House as an example

Mobile apps and websites aren't the only products that should focus on designing communities. You could build an exact replica of any one of Soho House membership clubs, but you would most certainly fail if you didn't have their members.

If you're not familiar with Soho House, it's a members club/hotel/restaurant that caters to people working in the creative industry, and they're known for having a strict "no-assholes rule" in their membership selection criteria (even if you're an A-lister).

What's really interesting is what happened at the New York Soho House in 2010. The club began to grow popular amongst the suit-wearing corporate types, which lead to a rule banning members from wearing suits and ties at the clubs, but even still... the club didn't feel like a real Soho House.

Soho House decided to kick out/cancel all of its New York members (around 500) in an attempt at getting the club 'back to its level of cool'. This might seem like a stupid move especially given that the annual cost of membership at a single club starts at $2,100... but it worked.

Today, Soho House still remains as one of the most exclusive and sought after membership clubs in the world, with growing revenues of $371 million per year and very little change to its membership criteria.

In an attempt at 'opening up', Soho House has allowed the general public to dine and **take pictures** at its 14 restaurants. These restaurants often have the same interior style of its membership clubs, a smart move by Soho House which allows them to cater to people who don't meet their criteria without pushing away their ideal members.

### The future is close-knit

Eventually, your product will need to open up (mostly for revenue growth reasons), but I think in the future we'll see more products taking this close-knit community approach.

Snapchat was on to this but lost its way in pursuit of a fast-functioning business model. The early days of Snapchat felt like an authentic social network where you actually knew all of your friends, and it lacked any 'status-obtaining' methods. The added screenshot detection feature added a massive level of trust/privacy to the app (similar to Soho House no pictures rule).

As with a lot of startups, Snapchat wasn't built with the intention of making any money, so they had to raise funding from investors. Just four years after founding the company, Evan & Bobby raised $635M in funding and was now rushing against time to prove that the platform could turn over a profit in the future.

As a result, the Snapchat community which was originally built as a close-knit social network had turned itself into a content giant filled with branded content and transformed its private community into 'content creators' by encouraging them to create viral content and increase their online status.

I'm can't remember the last time anyone mentioned anything about Snapchat to me, other than it's poorly performing stock price.

### So how should I design my product?

When thinking about the idea for your product, also envision a functioning community along with it. Build an MVP, test it with your ideal community and pay attention to what happens. If they love it, continue building the product **for them.** If they hate it, **find out why and make changes.**

As your product begins to scale, it's important to keep a certain level of authenticity within your community, whether you decide to remain close-knit or open up. Curating 40, 100, or 500 thousand users is not an easy task, but you have to scale your traffic as a function of your initial community or you could fall into the trap of having a "beautiful product, but a lost community."
