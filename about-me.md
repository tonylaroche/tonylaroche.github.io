My name is Anthony. The area I care about the most is advancing human potential, I think a lot about artificial intelligence (as an enabler or human potential), education and human-centered design

These days, I'm building a better classroom through a startup I founded called [Clay](https://tryclay.com), building software that creates a foundation for all other learning apps. I also help traditional businesses operate more efficiently by improving their CCDA *(communication, collaboration, distribution and automation)* environments at [Roche Parker](https://rocheparker.com). I founded an event discovery and purchase application called Fete which was acquired by 2015.

Outside of work, I'm sailing, running, building side projects and ranting about new concepts.

I created this blog so I can share the lessons Iâ€™ve learnt over the past years. All of the successes, failures and embarrassments which I believe are worth sharing will be written here.

**N.b.** I'll update this page periodically... though no promises.
