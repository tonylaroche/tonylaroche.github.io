### Hello, I’m Anthony

I’m an entrepreneur, filmmaker, and cinephile. I’m the Founder of Clay, a startup I’m building to help students easily manage their grades, assignments and classes.

I previously founded [Roche Parker](https://rocheparker.com), a consulting firm which works with businesses and orginizations to improve their internal processes.

Outside of work, I enjoy sailing, making short films and learning about new concepts.

I created this blog so that I can share the lessons I’ve learnt over the past couple years exploring the startup world. All of the successes, failures and embarrassments which I believe are worth sharing will be written here.

Best,
Anthony
