My name is Anthony. \~\~The area I care about the most is advancing human potential, I think a lot about artificial intelligence (as an enabler of human potential), education and space.

These days, I'm building a better classroom through a startup I founded named Clay.

Outside of work, I'm sailing, reading, and writing about new concepts.

I created this blog, so I can share some of the experiences I've gone through over the past years, all of my learnings, achievements, failures, and mistakes which I believe are worth sharing will be written here.

Also, I'll update this page periodically... though no promises.\~\~
