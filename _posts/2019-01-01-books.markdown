description: What i'm reading
---

I sometimes get asked which books I believe are crucial in developing an entrepreneurial mindset. Typically, the average person resorts to "entrepreneur/business" books. I've found that a large percentage of these types of books are filled with complete BS, mostly because you can't teach someone to become an entreprenur. Being an entrepreneur is having a collection of several different skills/abilities that you combine to produce a some kind of output.

If you want to develop the mindset of an entrepreneur, you should be focused on learning topics such as game theory, behavioral economics, finance etc... the sooner you have an understanding of how these topics work, the less time you'll spend complaining on Instagram about why your friends aren't supporting your business.

I've always enjoyed viewing others' bookshelves, you can learn allot about someone by the type of books they read. So in good practise, I'm sharing my bookshelf with all of you. These are all the books that I currently own (some are at peers' homes). 

My shelves lack any particular order, so too does this list.

N.b: I stole [@Naval's](https://twitter.com/naval) idea of buying double copies to lend out/give away. There's a quite a few double copies still in their shipping boxes at my house, if you're located somewhat close to me and wanting to read something here. Send me an [email](a@tonylaroche.com).
