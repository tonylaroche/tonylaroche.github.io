description: why it's important to charge more.
---

At my first startup Fete we had a simple fee structure. 5 to 15 percent per ticket sale based on the event type. However, even though we had created the most advanced ticket platform in the entire region and simultaneously made it 100x easier for someone to buy a ticket from their phone. That didn't stop us from hearing these infamous three words "It's too much".

**To give a bit more context:**
Given that the average ticket for an event was $300. Our fee would've resulted in a loss of $15 per ticket.

Fifteen-Dollars... this is the amount that was considered too much by several organisers. Fifteen-Dollars was the difference between letting someone tap a button to get their ticket and having them go meet someone to buy a ticket.

At first I was stunned and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The amount of greed that was displayed at those meetings still bother me to this day.

Over time, those words didn't disappear. They became habitual.

Sometime last year around the founding time of Roche Parker I was contacted by a relative; I'm still not sure how we're related. This was a guy in his 50s who owned a relatively small business that sold power generators for computers. He wanted a website built for his business as their online presence was non-existent; and still is. From the start I should've spotted the red-flags:

- Not providing any details about what he wanted.
- Refusing to send an email and instead insisting on an in-person meeting.
- Pronouncing my last name wrong, even though we're "family".

Regardless, I went ahead and gave this guy 45 minutes of my time. When I got to his office he wasn't there and I had to sit for an hour because he insisted that the meeting was for 11am and not 10am. I still have the text where he said 10am :)

Out of the 45 minutes that was scheduled for this meeting, I kid you not. The first 30 minutes was this guy bragging about his outdated company. How he was better than all his competition. How he got government contracts and that his daughter (who's the head engineer) is the smartest person in the company and everyone else is "minimum-wage jackasses" He even pulled out a phone-book (google it if you don't know what it is) and showed me their ad placement.

I had sent him a couple projects my team had worked on prior to the meeting. When it finally came time to asking him what he wanted. This guy looked me straight in my eyes and said, "I saw your work already and I didn't like it, it's terrible". Why I didn't get up and walk out at that point... I'm still not sure. I figured my time was already wasted, I've already missed my other meeting because he tried playing power-games. So I might as well carry this on and see what happens.

A bunch of back and forth took place until he eventually admitted that in his opinion, a website serves no real purpose at all and he just wants one for ego reasons. Those were his exact words.

Now for the best part, the cost. Without knowing any true details about this website project he asked "How much does this cost? I don't want any hourly pricing I want a flat rate number." I said, "We don't use flat rate pricing. But given what you asked for $1,700 an hour seems about right." 

At this point the guy loses his shit. Starts shouting at me "$1,700 an hour, who the fuck do you think you are to charge me that amount of money." "You better get the fuck out of here with that bullshit." "I'm not paying some nobody $1,700 for anything, I don't care how good you are."

I shook his hand and left his office. I never saw or heard from him again.

This is nowhere near the list of worst meetings I've been in, but it's definitely in the Top 20.

Whenever someone asks "why do you charge so much?" I always tell them, it's because I'm leading the way for those behind me. Ask any entrepreneur, artist, or creative you know how many times they've been insulted or disrespected. You'll hear countless experiences and it's something that we go through every single day.

I've passed on hundreds of job opportunities because my rates were too high and I don't regret a single one.

Why? Because there is a kid somewhere in the world right now learning how to program. That kid is going to lead the way forward, he'll change the way we do things forever.

But you only see him worth $500 and I refuse to support that.

So yes I charge A LOT for everything I do and It's not because I'm trying to get rich, It's because I want that kid to be respected and seen for what he truly is. Someone that will change the world one day.

And that principle lives on at [Roche Parker](https://rocheparker.com), we sent out an invoice to a private clinic for $104,823.92 for using HealthIQ last month. Expensive?... yes... Will we lose potential clients?.... yes... Is it worth it?.... yes.
