If you've ever attempted something challenging like starting a business or even running a marathon. You've probably seen a fair amount of motivational content.

![motivational quote](https://i2.wp.com/www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/sites/default/files/new2.jpg)

Every entrepreneurial, business, fitness, life advice page on Instagram has these types of quotes. These quotes follow one general idea. "If you want something bad enough, you have to be willing to work extremely hard for it."

This is terrible advice, and the reason why it continues to resonate; mostly among the younger crowd, is because it glorifies extreme struggle.

Pulling all nighters, working non-stop, having nervous breakdowns, and disputes with family and friends over your dreams are all seen as essential sacrifices in the pursuit of success.

This is all a lie and more importantly, it's incredibly dangerous towards yourself and others.

Showing the world that you're putting aside everything in your life and only focusing on something that'll yield you success may sound, and look good to your Instagram followers, but to everyone else and more importantly yourself. You're preparing yourself for massive failure.

I'm guilty of this myself. I founded fete; my first startup, at 15 years old with the intention of creating the largest nightlife platform in the world. I had told myself that nothing would get in the way of me achieving that goal. Most days, I would wake up at 10am and work till 7am, other days I would not sleep at all. I remember at one point I tried to stay up past 72 hours... I ended up in the ER for severe dehydration.

Why did I think this was okay? ...my mantra was "I'll sleep when I'm dead"

My new approach towards work/learning is 20/80. Put in 20% of the work and yield 80% of the results. It sounds ridiculous, but once you understand how it works it'll change your life forever; *as cliche as that sounds.*

Everyone has the same 24 hours every day. Our decision making abilities determine how we spend that timeline. The 20/80 rule is all about rational decision making.

**For example:** Staying up late working or pulling all-nighters will allow you to complete more work initially. However, the effects of sleep deprivation will drastically reduce your critical thinking and problem solving abilities to name a few. So while it may seem like more work is being completed on a daily basis, what you're actually doing is becoming slower and more irritated every day, working 80% of the time and only getting 20% worth of results.

Applying the 20/80 rule to this situation, if you were to ensure that you're getting at least 7 hours worth of sleep every night. Your brain is able to perform at its optimal level. You'll be able to recognise and execute on decisions that only require 20% of work and yield 80% output.

It's that simple.

Have you ever seen a fly that keeps trying to get outside through the glass of a closed window, but it can't see the open door right next to it?

That fly is hustling hard and grinding its way towards what it wants; it's putting out all its power. But not in the right direction.

Don't lock yourself in a room filled with open doors.

One more thing... 

Theres a trade off... You won't be able to brag about your struggle anymore. That means no more posts about your haters, friends not supporting your business, #goals #moneyovereverything #livingmybestlife etc...

In the age of social media, these are all methods we use to show others how better off we are. We both know the post you shared about being stressed and having a nervous breakdown isn't because you're anywhere near that level of stress. It's because you want people to believe your life is so amazingly overwhelming that you're suffering from critical mental distress.

Be honest with yourself and others, and remember the fly in the window.
