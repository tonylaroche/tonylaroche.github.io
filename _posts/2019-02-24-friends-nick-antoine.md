> **Note:** This is not a scientific study, it is purely anecdotal. There are a few psychological terms mentioned in this post which I encourage you to explore in your own time.

I consider [Nick Antoine](http://www.nickantoine.com) one of my close friends. He recently wrote a [post](nickantoine.com/true-friendship) on recognizing true friendship as you grow older–it's a great piece that I think everyone should read. However, I'd like to add in an additional point that he may have missed. The reason for factitious behaviour *i.e. Fake Friends.*

Putting aside things like sociopathic and narcissistic tendencies (which I will explore in another post). Everyone has experienced the "phenomenon" of once close friends making a paradigm shift in their behaviour. More often than not, this occurs whenever said friend graduates from high school and begins their professional career–in the work field or higher education.

The behaviour changes usually follow three stages:

**Stage One**: Approval & Validation

**Stage Two:** Flashing Lights

**Stage Three:** Guilt Trip

I'm going to briefly explore all three stages in this post. I will occasionally mention examples of situations that are based on real-life experiences. I'll try to destroy the linkage to the real person as I'm not trying to put anyone in the spotlight.

#### Stage One: Approval & Validation

Everyone want's to be loved, there isn't a single person reading this blog that's thinking to themselves "I want to be a nobody". Approval and Validation is something that's deeply embedded in all human beings, some of us seek it more than others. But generally, we all wish we could go back to being six years old–experiencing the overwhelming amount of love and compassion displayed by our parents, relatives and adolescent friends. That immersive feeling that you could do anything and become anything you wanted to be. The painting you once brought home from elementary school, it was seen as an incredible work of art. Everyone reacted as if they were viewing a piece of artwork by Vincent van Gogh himself.

But as we grew older, the things that once impressed the people that loved us the most, began to fade. You were introduced to a new measuring system, one that would predict your overall outcome in life. This measurement system became the single most important factor to your parents and peers during your late adolescence years... Grades/Test Scores.

> All of the studies I've read have shown that there is no correlation between grades and success outcome in life. I will note that the studies can be argued based on how you define success, but generally the only outcome grades can predict is for those who are seeking a life in academia.

Grades/Test Scores is the approval and validation tool adolescents love. It allows you to look at someone a confidently say *"I'm better than you, because I'm smarter than you"*. Teachers play an equal but dangerous part in this also, putting students in a hypnotic state where they believe that, number one in the class will be a doctor while number twenty will be picking up garbage on the street. Research has proven to us that this analogy is absolute bullshit, so what happens when these students leave the classroom?

Grades have no true value in the real world, so you resort to finding a new measurement scale. A very prestigious or hard to achieve career. This is the exact moment where stage one kicks in and the brain goes back to the classroom.

**Example One:**

> "My friends have been nice to me, but I work at the bank now and my friends are number 10-20 on the career scale. So I can't be associated with them anymore, I need to surround myself with people on the 1-5 scale with the focus on being number one."

**Example Two:**

> "I'm gaining a lot of popularity with this new entertainment job, there are a lot of people around me that are better than me and I want to be better than those people. My current friends are nowhere near my own level of popularity and they provide no value to me."

If you haven't caught on already, the reason for this behaviour goes back to the classroom. No one wanted to be the student labeled as "Garbage Man" or even the mediocre student who did well enough to pass. Everyone wants to be number one–the straight A student who makes their own cousins, let alone friends jealous of their success.

 Your career is the new validation tool, it allows you to say "I'm still better than you". And when it comes to approval and validation, the human mind does not give a shit about your friends. It simple understands a scale of 1-20 and that if you go past 5 on that scale, you're a failure.

#### Stage Two: Flashing Lights

My generation is the first generation that will live two lives, one in base reality and another in a simulated environment. Social Networks were created with the intention of connecting us to new people and new information, what started off as a great project has turned into an incredible disaster.

So many of you are full of shit, your FaceTuned VSCO edited pictures on Instagram tell lies. The pictures you're posting to your stories–eating sushi, hanging out at luxury places, laughing with the beautiful people and living life stress free is all bull-shite.

These people have become so obsessed with the flashing lights that they can't differentiate between what's real and what's not anymore. It's about creating an illusion of happiness, success, and wealth to receive validation from strangers.

How can someone be comfortable with eight-hundred (800) people liking a picture of themselves? Do you have any idea of how many people that actually is?

It's insane that people have indebted themselves to seek approval and validation from others. For a lot of people, one of the most important factors when buying a new car is the status it provides.

**Example One:**

> "I can't wait to see my neighbours and friends faces when they see my new Mercedes."

People are willing to spend double the price of a regular bottle of Hennessy in a party, just so everyone else in the club will think you're a high-roller.

It's important to note that this is where most people become deceiving towards their current friends. If you're the friend with the brightest lights, you'll be deceived by the friend who's lights shine dim. However, if the lights aren't bright enough… you'll be kicked off the stage.

It's relatively easy to spot which friends are caught up in the lights. I'll state some typical examples:

* Posting motivational quotes such as "Make your circle smaller, and your bank account bigger".
* Everywhere they go, they're taking pictures instead of enjoying the experience.
* They're overwhelmingly nice towards you, until they meet someone with brighter lights.

#### Stage Three: Guilt Trip

If someone has backstabbed you before, the only chance of you getting an apology from them is if you're doing better than them. I've experienced this many times over.

At some point the lights will come down, and you'll realise that the people around you are just like yourself–having low self esteem, materialistic and greedy. It only lasts for a short time before these groups implode. A once seemingly successful circle of friends suddenly at war with each other.

Isolating yourself from the rest of the world and surrounding yourself with only people you consider successful will not make you any more successful than you're already capable of. It will cause chaos and you will soon realise this if you're currently in that position.

I personally don't accept people back into my circle after I've seen them go through all the stages. It's your choice whether you'll accept them or not. I don't know what comes after that because I've never allowed myself to go through it.

Those are my thoughts on "fake friends" and while I may have rambled a bit in this post, I hope the message is delivered properly.
