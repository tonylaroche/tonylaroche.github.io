Over the years I’ve changed quite a bit as a person. I remember when a close friend said "try and adapt to the new enviorment". Surprisingly, I've adapted quite well–but along that path; I’ve lost my true vision, my deep interest in technology and my sense of self worth. From now on, I’m giving up my adapted self–which I believe is rational step in moving forward.

**I’ve never been the type of person to excommunicate someone from my life. However, being fair with myself, I have made some terrible choices regarding the people I surround myself with. I am not immediately excommunicating anyone… I simply ask of you to be mindful of someone going through changes.**

Changes will be visible through my interactions, opinions, speech and appearance. I'm not interested in discussing this topic with anyone, accept it and move on. From now on, I will be focusing exclusively on [Clay](https://tryclay.com) and [Roche Parker](https://rocheparker.com) (including all its sub-ventures). At this time I am not interested in any new short term projects or short term relationships.

I'm not interested in doing software development, graphic design or film-production as individual work for anyone. If you’re a business/entrepreneur seeking software development or automation in your venture, reach out to the engineering team at [Roche Parker](https://www.rocheparker.com/projects/).

Thank you for understanding.
