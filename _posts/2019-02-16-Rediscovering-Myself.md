Over the years I’ve changed quite a bit as a person. I distinctively remember in the early days of returning to Trinidad, a close friend once told me that I should “try to adapt”… unfortunately, I did adapt and along that path I’ve lost my ways, my deep interest in technology, my leadership abilities and my sense of self worth. Today, I’m fully separating from my new self. Which is not something you hear often, but I deeply believe this is critical in moving forward.

I’ve never been the type of person to excommunicate someone from my life. However, being fair with myself, I have made some terrible choices regarding the people I surround myself with. Again, I am not excommunicating anyone… I simply ask of you to be mindful of someone going through changes.

Changes will be visible through my interactions, opinions, speech and appearance. I'm not interested in discussing/debating this topic with anyone. Accept it and move on. Moving forward I will be focusing exclusively on [Clay](https://tryclay.com) and [Roche Parker](https://rocheparker.com) (including all its sub ventures). I am not interested in any new short term projects or short term relationships.

I am no longer doing graphic design, software development or film-making as individual work for anyone. If you’re a business owner/entrepreneur seeking software development or automation in your venture, reach out to the engineering team at [Roche Parker](https://www.rocheparker.com/projects/).

Thank you for understanding.
