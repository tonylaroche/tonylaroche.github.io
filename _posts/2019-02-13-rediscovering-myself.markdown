# Rediscovering Myself
Over the years I’ve changed quite a bit as a person.I distinctively remember in the early days of returning to Trinidad, a close friend once told me that I should “try to integrate”… Unfortunately, I **did** integrate.

Along that path I’ve lost my ways, my deep interest in technology, my leadership abilities and my sense of self worth.

Today at twenty-one years of age, I’m fully separating from my new self. _Which is not something you hear often at all_, but I deeply believe that this is critical in moving forward.

I’m never been the type of person to excommunicate someone from my life. However, being fair with myself, I have made some terrible choices regarding the people I surround myself with. Again, I am not excommunicating anyone… I simply ask of you to be mindful of someone going through changes.

Moving forward I’ll be focusing exclusively on Clay and Roche Parker _(including all its sub ventures)_. I am not interested in any new short term projects or relationships.

I am no longer doing graphic design, software development or film-making as individual work for anyone. If you’re a business owner/entrepreneur seeking software development or automation in your venture, reach out to the engineering team at [Roche Parker](https://www.rocheparker.com/projects/).

Thank you all for understanding,

– Tony
