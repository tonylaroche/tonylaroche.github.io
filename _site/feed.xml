          <description>&lt;p&gt;I sometimes get asked which books I believe are crucial in developing an entrepreneurial mindset. Typically, the average person resorts to “entrepreneur/business” books. I’ve found that a large percentage of these types of books are filled with complete BS, mostly because you can’t teach someone to become an entreprenur. Being an entrepreneur is having a collection of several different skills/abilities that you combine to produce a some kind of output.&lt;/p&gt;
